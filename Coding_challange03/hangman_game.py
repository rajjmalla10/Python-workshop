# letters_guessed, a list of letters (strings) that the user has previously guessed. You will
# need to write additional code to compare these letters against the full alphabet to determine the
# letters that remain and return them as a string.
# Hint: You may find the string.ascii_lowercase variable useful, which generates a list
# of alphabetical letters in lowercase. The string library has been imported for you.
